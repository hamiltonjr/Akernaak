# Akernaak
	
	This is a new release for an old adventure game.

In the 80s the game A Casa de Akernaak (Akernaak's House) made some success among the young students and gamers. It's a non-graphical
adventure game, a common type of game for when the graphical resources still not developed. The game was developed in BASIC and it was
published at Geração Prológica, 13 magazine. The code is typed compacted and it's the use in the 80s for code running on interpreters.
I typed the ancient code and I found an interpreter in the Internet: the QW-BASIC, at PC-BASIC Project (Rob Hagemans at SourceForge).
I modified the code for to be non-compacted and better readable. But some things of ancient programming are not in my mind and the 
code still with bugs. I'm working for fixing it.

Project:
- put the ancient BASIC code up and running
- develop a Java and a Python version of game
- develop graphical interface for the game
- develop an Android version and post in the Google Store
